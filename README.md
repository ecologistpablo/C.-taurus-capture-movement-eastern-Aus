# Grey nurse shark capture and movement in eastern Australia
This repository was created by Pablo Fuenzalida, as a part of an honours thesis completed in 2023. 
Our research focuses on utilising acoustic telemetry from IMOS (imos.org.au) as well as Queensland department of agriculture and fisheries (DAF) and NSW department of primary industries (DPI) shark control program bycatch data for grey nurse sharks (Carcharias taurus) to connect the migratory movements on a continent scale between certain key aggregation sites with bycatch occurences in the shark control program.

# DISCLAIMER #
The analysis conducted in this repo utilises data from multiple governmental agencies QLD DAF and NSW DPI, as such data agreements had to be obtained in order to acquire, analyse and publish this data. Part of that agreement was that no data will be published before a manuscript has been published with thorough consultation from both agenices. Due to this, we are unable to post any scripts, data or analysis related to the shark control program analysis as of yet. 

So this repo will just contain the analysis of openly available data, C. taurus detections accessed from the AODN portal (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/), you can replicate this for any species however.
