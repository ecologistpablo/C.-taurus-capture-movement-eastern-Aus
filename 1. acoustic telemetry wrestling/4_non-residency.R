    # VTrack broken - so we endure without it

# non-residency is just as important as residency
# we can quantify it by arranging detections by tag id and datetime
# and connecting one ping with the next using lead / lag
# to see when an animal moved from one receiver to the next
# we can then add filters in space and time
# but we shall do that later

# load library and data ---------------------------------------------------
