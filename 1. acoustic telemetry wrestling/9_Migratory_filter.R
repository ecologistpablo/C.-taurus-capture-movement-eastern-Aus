   #removing the small movements in our data set

# conceptual background on script -----------------------------------------

# my study wants to look at migratory movements only
# so we will filter small movements out of this
# sharks sometimes will leave a "location" only to return immediately
# this could be seen as a foraging movement or just a little swim outside and back 
# we want to remove these movements
# this script removes movements that leave, get detected outside a location within 50 km 
# only to return back to the beginning location within 24 h 
# I've written it into little functions so you can edit the temporal and spatial thresholds
# because we are open - source scientists who are cool like that 
# each movement is one row
# so we begin by targeting unique tags in multiples of 4 (departure, arrival, departure arrival)


# packages ----------------------------------------------------------------
